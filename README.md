[Blairpath](http://www.blairpath.org) is a website that provides mapping tools to help students, teachers, and visitors of [Montgomery Blair High School](mbhs.edu) navigate and survey the **200+ rooms and other landmarks** across **3 floors** on the school campus.

## Sources for Map Background Images
In November 2019, I found the original background images on designshare.com. As of April 2021, that website is defunct, so I've included Wayback Machine links to the pages and files I used.
