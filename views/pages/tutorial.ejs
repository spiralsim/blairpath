				<h1>Tutorial</h1>

				<h3>Viewing the School</h3>
				<p>By default, the floor plan is the only map shown on the screen. You can independently show/hide the floor plan and site plan using the respective checkboxes.</p>
				<p>You can click and drag on the map to pan the camera. To zoom, either scroll with the mouse wheel (recommended) or press the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> buttons. To reset all movement, press <code>Reset View</code>.</p>

				<h3>Selecting Places</h3>
				<p>By default, each place has its name displayed on the map.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Left side:</b> You can select a point textually by typing its name or purpose in one of the text fields in the places list.</li>
					<li><b>Right side:</b> To graphically interact with a place, you can click on its name on the map.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Two types of places have special naming conventions:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Portables are named <code>P[number]</code>.
						<ul>
							<li>Example: <code>P6</code> is Portable 6.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Bathrooms are named <code>[gender]s' Bathroom [floor][side]</code>.
						<ul>
							<li>Example 1: <code>Boys' Bathroom 2L</code> is the boys' bathroom on the left side of Floor 2.</li>
							<li>Example 2: <code>Girls' Bathroom 3R</code> is the girls' bathroom on the right side of Floor 3.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Calculating Routes</h3>
				<p>After you have selected at least two places, you have the option to allow the path to use the elevator.</p>
				<p>Then, press <code>Find Path</code> to compute and analyze the shortest routes between each pair of consecutive places.</p>

				<!--
				<h3>Additional Tools</h3>
				<p>A few additional tools are available on the map's menu:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The bar under the scale next to the compass can also be clicked to activate a ruler. After the ruler is activated, you can left-click on the map to add markers to measure between or right-click on existing markers to delete them.</li>
				</ul>
				-->
